# MARS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/saagarjha/MARS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/saagarjha/MARS)

This is a custom fork of the [MARS MIPS simulator](http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/) that I've modified to run better on my Mac. In particular, I've added resources to package the JAR as an app bundle, added a nicer icon, used a native file chooser, and modified the layout a bit to work better on smaller screens. You can grab a copy off of the [releases](https://github.com/saagarjha/MARS/releases) page.
